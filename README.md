Hi All!
The main idea is to add/update the thumb base to match the Redump dat which is a default dat for CD32 games on Retroarch.
A lot of people complain that games/thumbs don't show up automatically, that's why my plan is to add also the CD32 TOSEC dat to the CD32 database.
But first things first.

- naming matches the Redump dat 2024-09-02
- original packaging if possible (big box > jewel case)
- additional real/fake jewel-box covers for people who want to have everything 'squared' (512x512pix)
- boxarts - high(er) resolution sources and more natural colors (download to compare)
- new titles/pics will be added in original resolution (320x256pix x 8bit, probabably 98% of cases, some menus on multigame disks have higher resolution)

Next next step will be updating the WHDLoad database, it's quite old 

In case of any problems/suggestions, please let me know.
Cheers!
