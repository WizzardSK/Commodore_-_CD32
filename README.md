Hi All!
The main idea is to add/update the thumb base to match the Redump dat which is a default dat for CD32 games on Retroarch.
A lot of people complain that games/thumbs don't show up automatically, that's why my plan is to add also the CD32 TOSEC dat to the CD32 database.

REDUMP - done:
- naming matches the Redump dat 2024-09-02
- original packaging if possible (big box > jewel case)
- additional real/fake jewel-box covers for people who want to have everything 'squared' (512x512pix)
- boxarts - high(er) resolution sources and more natural colors (download to compare)
- titles/snaps added in original resolution (320x256pix x 8bit, probabably 96% of cases)
- the thumbset fully works with both Scan Directory (DAT file based scanning) and Manual Scan (create list form the zips in a folder)

TOSEC - half done:
 - database added
 - naming matches the latest TOSEC-Games ISO/BIN/IMG DATs
 - alternative set of boxarts (512x512); high(er) resolution sources and more natural colors (download to compare)
 - titles/snaps added in original resolution (320x256pix x 8bit, probabably 96% of cases)
 - works with Manual Scan; I'll try to do some magic and make the one thumb-set fully compatibile with both types of scanning, but in case of ISOs Retroarch builds the playlist in a weird way (also had problems with scanning IMG files, but that has been solved)

COVERDISKS - done:
 - thumbset covers both TOSEC-Coverdisks-ISO dat and coverdisks from the Redump set
 - please use the Scan Directory option to see a clean list with all the thumbs displayed; Redump coverdisk naming convention is all over the place

TO DO:
- some changes to TOSEC CD32 database
- update the AmigaWHDL dat and add matching thumbs

In case of any problems/suggestions, please let me know.
Cheers!
